								<h3><u>Training Description</u></h3>
								<p>This was an internal training course organized and directed by a team member at Calian Advanced Technologies.</p>
								<p>The course was delivered over approximately 10 weeks with session per week lasting 1-2 hours per session.
									These sessions were interactive follow along lessons where the group work through deploying a python rest api application with 
									a redis datastore to various Kubernetes cluster configurations.
								</p>
								<p>
									For this training we ran Kubernetes in a local cluster using 'kind', and I personally ran it on
									a Ubuntu VM on my personal laptop at home. There was also an accompanying training course put on by Calian 
									the year before on the subject of docker. I did not attend the docker training but was able to look over 
									the notes for the docker course on my own.
								</p>
								<p>
									During this training course we learned about various resources types such as:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Pods
										</li>
										<li>
											Deployments
										</li>
										<li>
											Services
										</li>
										<li>
											Volume Mounts
										</li>
										<li>
											Config Maps
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									We also learned about tools like k9s for managing the system, and helm charts for
									publishing our kubernetes configurations and reusing previous published configurations.
								</p>
								<h3><u>The Example Application</u></h3>

								<p>
									In this image of the k9s command line interface, you can see a list of pods, with the first one 
									being the "python-rest-api" pod. This was the main application we were deploying during this training.
									It was a small example application that had a few rest endpoints which we were able to access with a 
									web browser once everything was setup correctly. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This application was a good example, because as we went along deploying it we needed to include different resources types.
									For example, to make the application accessible outside of the cluster, we needed to use either port-fortwarding or a service resource type.
									Then once we were able to access the application port from outside the kind cluster, we started to add in the redis datastore to support the 
									"/get" and "/put" endpoints. To do this we needed volumne mounts to setup a disk on which the redis datastore could run. 
									Finally, once the disk was setup, we downloaded a helm chart with a starting redis configuration that we could override with the relevant
									configuration to get our app working. 
								</p>
								<p>We also learned about adding config maps to provide a configuration file to the application.</p>

										The config endpoint shows the configuration of the application. Some of this configuration (for example, server.cowsay) was set
										from an environment variable. Other configuration was set via a configuration file read in when the application
										started running.
