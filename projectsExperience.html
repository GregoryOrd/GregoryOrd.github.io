								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>Helping Hands is the purposed name for a startup business venture that I am involved with. The goal of this endeavour is to provide technological solutions to improve the efficiency of student run caf&eacute programs in schools. More specifically, this technology is aimed at caf&eacute programs where the students are enrolled in the school's special education program and the caf&eacute organizers are occuptional therapists. These people and departments in schools are often forgotten and lack technology tailored to their specific needs. Helping Hands addresses this issue and provides helpful services to these school caf&eacutes. </p>
									<p>The inspiration for Helping Hands came from a University of Calgary track teammate, Jan Erik Naess. Jan Erik discovered this problem through the school where his mom was working and came to me in the fall of 2019 asking me to help him develop a solution. The only technology the program had in place was a Google Form that allowed customers to place orders. Once orders were placed occuptional therapists would print large exessive summaries and then filter data manually. This was very hard and time consuming. Helping Hands has since developed a web application and an automatic label printing solution to optimize this process. </p>
									<p>As of January 2020, we are still only in our first school, Hinsdale South High School in Darien, Illinois, but we are looking to expand to others in that area of the United States and potentially also in Canada. The staff at Hinsdale has been great in working with us to develop our product and ideas.</p>
									<p>In addition to the new technology, we have developed some marketing material to help the Hinsdale caf&eacute draw in more customers. In the future we plan to add more features such as customer accounts, an improved order form, and a performance measurement system to track how students are progressing in the time it takes them to make and deliver orders. We hope that eventually we can collect data on students' performance and allow students to put that data on resumes to help them get jobs after they graduate. </p>

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>
										Thus far during the project, I have learned a lot about Google's developer products, Windows batch scripting, and Brother's label printers. The web side of this project has been done using Google Apps Script because it easily integrates with the Google Forms and Spreadsheets that the school was already using. The thought of moving away from Google to have our own system has come up, but we have decided to stick with Google for now because many of the other schools we had heard of with similar programs also use Google Forms.
									</p>
									<p>Google also has a cloud print service. However, we had formatting issues when using this to send print jobs to the label printer. The solution to automate printing was then to using batch scripting and some python to download data from a Google drive, open printing software, and print orders with a preformatted template. This is currently done with a Windows laptop as a 'print server'. I have learned that Brother's QL series label printer support the use of raster and ESC-P commands. Later improvements to the printing solution will likely use these capability to bypass the printer's drivers and send raw binary data directly from our application to the printer. We are also considering the switch to using a small raspberry pi device as a print server instead of a full flegded Windows laptop.</p>

									<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>The goal of this project was to build an application to allow clients in group counselling programs to complete assessment questionnaires each week throughout a 10-14 week program duration. The application was web-based and was presented to clients via tablets connected to the Calgary Counselling Centre's internal network. This project was completed by myself and another summer student using C# and the .NET framework.</p>
									<video width="50%" class="videoRight" controls>
										<source src="GWMX6921.mp4" type="video/mp4">

									</video>
									<p>The Calgary Counselling Centre runs 12 different group programs for clients with different needs. Some of the programs are for adults, while others are intended for children. Each group has a "Pre-Package" which is completed at the first session, a "Post-Package" which was completed at the final session, and a standard package that is completed at every session in  between. Each package consists of a variable number of individual questionnaires. The application needed to be able to get the client's log-in information, determine which questionnaire package the client was to complete that day, then serve that package to the client. The client's questionnaire answer data was then stored in a database before being pulled out and processed by a software used by counsellors and the centre's Research department. In total, there were about 40 individual questionnaires arranged into approximately 30 packages.</p><br />
									<h4><u>Project Add-ons</u></h4>
									<p>In addition to the main project requirements, my partner and I had and implemented some ideas to make the project more complete. The first was an editing interface that allowed users to modify the contents of programs, packages, sections and questions. This functioned through a web API. The second add-on was an automated emailing system. This system detected common database configuration errors and sent an appropriate email to the Centre's IT Coordinator in response. The system was also capable of sending summary reports of important questions, but this feature was turned off. Finally, simple interface was built with another web API to allow retrieve client entered question data. The interface allowed the user to specify filters such as date, program type, package type, client, etc. On the client-side, the retrieved data was formatted into an excel spreadsheet that could be downloaded and inputted into the software used by the Research Department.</p>
									<!--<p>In addition, I had the idea to attach a simple automated emailing system to the project. We implemented this to send emails to the Center's IT coordinator when database errors where detected, and to send summary reports of key questions to counsellors and the coordinator of children's groups.</p>-->

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>									
									<p>As my first industry experience, I learned that being flexible throughout the development process is very important as requirements can change and be added at any moment. I also learned a lot about teamwork in software development. My partner and I worked very well together during this project; often one of his ideas would spark an idea in me which would then spark an idea in him and allow us to find the best solution to whatever problem we were facing. I learned that when designing a system it is important to design for the future as well as for the present moment...and I also learned a little bit about the .NET framework, C#, SQL, databases, HTML, javascript and CSS.</p></div>

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This application was built as the term project for the ENSF 409 - Principles of Software Development course at the University of Calgary. The instructor of the course introduced this project first as a part a weekly lab assignment. The course focused heavily on object oriented design, and used Java as the language of instruction.</p>
									<p>The first step in the lab assignment was to analyze the project's problem statement and create a UML class diagram. The second step was use this class diagram to create a simple console based application. Text files were provided as inital data input into the application, and the user was presented with a menu from the command-line/console to add, delete, and edit information related to tools in the inventory of a toolshop.</p>
									<p>Weeks later, the work for this lab assignment was brought back for the course's final project. The goal of the final project was to transform this simple one machine console based application into a Client-Server application. Lots of emphasis was placed proper system design and another set of class diagrams was created. The instruction was to build this application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. A simple graphical user interface was built for the client, and a mySQL database replaced text files on the server-side. The client and server programs communicated through socket programming, and the server was required to use a thread pool to handle concurrency and multiple clients at the same time.</p><br />

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>
										From a learning standpoint, this was a very involved project. It helped in me to develop an understanding of client-server architecture, the MVC design pattern, multithreading and socket programming. At the time this was the largest project I had worked on, and I think this project was the first to give me a sense of how much planning and design work goes into creating quality software.

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This was a weekend warrior type project that I worked on during the summer of 2017. This project was a web-based application, built using PHP, that allowed distance runners to create accounts and then store data related to their training in a database. The inspiration for this project came from my involvment in the sport and awareness of the importance of keeping a proper training log. I viewed the project as an opportunity to learn about the technology and get a sense for how other training log websites, like Garmin Connect or Strava, might work.</p>
									<p>This project did not reach completion by the end of summer 2017 and got put on the backburner when school begin in September. However, I did feel that I took this project far enough to achieve the goal of learning the basics of how client-side and server side languages work together in a web application to navigate from page to page, pass data, and interact with a database.</p><br />

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>Looking back at this project it is interesting to see how many things I could have done better, and how much I have learned since then. From a user experience point of view, the two main area for improvement are mobile responsiveness and dynamic display of formatted run/workout data. These are areas that I feel I have greatly improved upon with the my work at the Calgary Counselling Centre and with this personal portfolio website. If I were to do the training log project again a lot of things would be different, but overall I think it was a good learning experience.</p>

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This was another project for fun in the summer of 2017.  The idea for the project came from a youtube video. The video was about 20 minutes long and showed how to use the Twilio API to send an SMS message with python.</p>
									<p>To expand on what was shown in the video, I decided to add a password system that identified the user an sent the message to a different phone number based on the user. I also decided to add a user interface. To do this I used the Tkinter python library, and this was my first introduction to graphical user interfaces. This little app also added to the ideas presented in the video by using ngrok webhooks to allow for the phone that recieved the initial message to send a response back to the computer.</p><br/>

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This project was my first "real" project and came at the end of the first programming class I ever took, ENGG 233 - Computing for Engineers. The course was an introductory programming course, taught using a language called Processing, and this was the final project for the course.</p>
									<p>The objective of the project was to create a simple game that simulated billiards/pool. The game was only single player and did not involve any rules except that if you sunk the white ball the game was over. The player controlled their que stick with the mouse and adjusted the power of their shot with the up and down arrow keys. Addition features such as a timer and sound effects allowed students to gain bonus points on the grading of the assignment.</p><br />

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>This project was given to the class just after we had covered classes and objects in the lectures. It was my first experience building a system with these concepts. I remember that on my first attempt at this project nothing was working, so I completely stoped my work and began again completely from scratch.</p>
									<p>On the second attempt I restuctured my classes and everything went super smoothly. The main lesson I took away from this was the lesson that how a program is structured does matter and doing things correctly at the beginning will make things a lot easier at the end.</p>
