This was my first industry experience and it taught me a lot about how much work and due diligence goes in to building a stable product that interacts with many different users. This and some other smaller personal and academic projects are described below.</h4></div>

					<h1>Calgary Counselling Centre Group Testing App</h1>
					<br/><p>The goal of this project was to build an application to allow clients in group counselling programs to complete assessment questionnaires each week for the 10-14 week program duration. The application was web-based and was presented to clients via tablets connected to the Calgary Counselling Centre's internal network. This project was completed by myself and another summer student using C# and the .NET framework.</p>
					<p>The Calgary Counselling Centre runs 10-12 different group programs for clients with different needs. Some of the programs are for adults, while others are intended for children. Each group had a "Pre-Package" which was completed at the first session, a "Post-Package: which was completed at the final session, and a standard package that was completed once every week between the first and last sessions. Each package consisted of a variable number of individual questionnaires. The application needed to be able to get the client's log-in information, determine which questionnaire package the client was to complete that day, then serve that package to the client. This data was then stored in a database before being pulled out an processed by a software used by counsellors and the centre's Research department. In total, there were about 40 individual questionnaires.</p><br />

					<p><br />As my first industry experience, I learned that being flexible throughout the development process is very important as requirements can change and be added at any moment. I also learned a lot about teamwork in software development. My partner and I worked very well together during this project; often one of his ideas would spark an idea in me which would then spark and idea in him and allow us to find the best solution to whatever problem we faced. I learned that desigining a system for the future as well as desiging a system for right now is very important...and I also learned a little bit about C#, .NET, HTML, javascript and CSS.</p></div>
