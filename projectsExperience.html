									<br/><p>The goal of this project was to build an application to allow clients in group counselling programs to complete assessment questionnaires each week throughout a 10-14 week program duration. The application was web-based and was presented to clients via tablets connected to the Calgary Counselling Centre's internal network. This project was completed by myself and another summer student using C# and the .NET framework.</p>

									<p>The Calgary Counselling Centre runs 12 different group programs for clients with different needs. Some of the programs are for adults, while others are intended for children. Each group has a "Pre-Package" which is completed at the first session, a "Post-Package" which was completed at the final session, and a standard package that is completed at every session in  between. Each package consists of a variable number of individual questionnaires. The application needed to be able to get the client's log-in information, determine which questionnaire package the client was to complete that day, then serve that package to the client. The client's questionnaire answer data was then stored in a database before being pulled out and processed by a software used by counsellors and the centre's Research department. In total, there were about 40 individual questionnaires arranged into approximately 30 packages.</p><p>In addition, I had the idea to attach a simple automated emailing system to the project. We implemented this to send emails to the Center's IT coordinator when database errors where detected, and to send summary reports of key questions to counsellors and the coordinator of children's groups.</p>

									<p><br />As my first industry experience, I learned that being flexible throughout the development process is very important as requirements can change and be added at any moment. I also learned a lot about teamwork in software development. My partner and I worked very well together during this project; often one of his ideas would spark an idea in me which would then spark an idea in him and allow us to find the best solution to whatever problem we were facing. I learned that when designing a system it is important to design for the future as well as for the present moment...and I also learned a little bit about the .NET framework, C#, SQL, databases, HTML, javascript and CSS.</p></div>

									<p>This application was built as the term project for the ENSF 409 - Principles of Software Development course at the University of Calgary. The instructor of the course introduced this project first as a part a weekly lab assignment. The course focused heavily on object oriented design, and used Java as the language of instruction.</p>
									<p>The first step in the lab assignment was to analyze the project's problem statement and create a UML class diagram. The second step was use this class diagram to create a simple console based application. Text files were provided as inital data input into the application, and the user was presented with a menu from the command-line/console to add, delete, and edit information related to tools in the inventory of a toolshop.</p>
									<p>Weeks later, the work for this lab assignment was brought back for the course's final project. The goal of the final project was to transform this simple one machine console based application into a Client-Server application. Lots of emphasis was placed proper system design and another set of class diagrams was created. The instruction was to build this application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. A simple graphical user interface was built for the client, and a mySQL database replaced text files on the server-side. The client and server programs communicated through socket programming, and the server was required to use a thread pool to handle concurrency and multiple clients at the same time.</p><br />

										From a learning standpoint, this was a very involved project. It helped in me to develop an understanding of client-server architecture, the MVC design pattern, multithreading and socket programming. At the time this was the largest project I had worked on, and I think this project was the first to give me a sense of how much planning and design work goes into creating quality software.

									<br /><p>This was a weekend warrior type project that I worked on during the summer of 2017. This project was a web-based application, built using PHP, that allowed distance runners to create accounts and then store data related to their training in a database. The inspiration for this project came from my involvment in the sport and awareness of the importance of keeping a proper training log. I viewed the project as an opportunity to learn about the technology and get a sense for how other training log websites, like Garmin Connect or Strava, might work.</p>
									<p>This project did not reach completion by the end of summer 2017 and got put on the backburner when school begin in September. However, I did feel that I took this project far enough to achieve the goal of learning the basics of how client-side and server side languages work together in a web application to navigate from page to page, pass data, and interact with a database.</p><br />

									<p>Looking back at this project it is interesting to see how many things I could have done better, and how much I have learned since then. From a user experience point of view, the two main area for improvement are mobile responsiveness and dynamic display of formatted run/workout data. These are areas that I feel I have greatly improved upon with the my work at the Calgary Counselling Centre and with this personal portfolio website. If I were to do the training log project again a lot of things would be different, but overall I think it was a good learning experience.</p>

									<p>This was another project for fun in the summer of 2017.  The idea for the project came from a youtube video. The video was about 20 minutes long and showed how to use the Twilio API to send an SMS message with python.</p>
									<p>To expand on what was shown in the video, I decided to add a password system that identified the user an sent the message to a different phone number based on the user. I also decided to add a user interface. To do this I used the Tkinter python library, and this was my first introduction to graphical user interfaces. This little app also added to the ideas presented in the video by using ngrok webhooks to allow for the phone that recieved the initial message to send a response back to the computer.</p><br/>

									<p>The main take aways from this project were learning about APIs, webhooks, and graphical user interfaces. This project introduced me to the idea of sending requests from one machine to another, and seeing how this can be triggered by event based programming.</p>
