									<br/><p>The goal of this project was to build an application to allow clients in group counselling programs to complete assessment questionnaires each week throughout a 10-14 week program duration. The application was web-based and was presented to clients via tablets connected to the Calgary Counselling Centre's internal network. This project was completed by myself and another summer student using C# and the .NET framework.</p>

									<p>The Calgary Counselling Centre runs 12 different group programs for clients with different needs. Some of the programs are for adults, while others are intended for children. Each group has a "Pre-Package" which is completed at the first session, a "Post-Package" which was completed at the final session, and a standard package that is completed at every session in  between. Each package consists of a variable number of individual questionnaires. The application needed to be able to get the client's log-in information, determine which questionnaire package the client was to complete that day, then serve that package to the client. The client's questionnaire answer data was then stored in a database before being pulled out and processed by a software used by counsellors and the centre's Research department. In total, there were about 40 individual questionnaires arranged into approximately 30 packages.</p><p>In addition, I had the idea to attach a simple automated emailing system to the project. We implemented this to send emails to the Center's IT coordinator when database errors where detected, and to send summary reports of key questions to counsellors and the coordinator of children's groups.</p>

									<p><br />As my first industry experience, I learned that being flexible throughout the development process is very important as requirements can change and be added at any moment. I also learned a lot about teamwork in software development. My partner and I worked very well together during this project; often one of his ideas would spark an idea in me which would then spark an idea in him and allow us to find the best solution to whatever problem we were facing. I learned that when designing a system it is important to design for the future as well as for the present moment...and I also learned a little bit about the .NET framework, C#, SQL, databases, HTML, javascript and CSS.</p></div>

									<br /><p>This was a weekend warrior type project that I worked on during the summer of 2017. This project was a web-based application, built using PHP, that allowed distance runners to create accounts and then store data related to their training in a database. The inspiration for this project came from my involvment in the sport and awareness of the importance of keeping a proper training log. I viewed the project as an opportunity to learn about the technology and get a sense for how other training log websites, like Garmin Connect or Strava, might work.</p>
									<p>This project did not reach completion by the end of summer 2017 and got put on the backburner when school begin in September. However, I did feel that I took this project far enough to achieve the goal of learning the basics of how client-side and server side languages work together in a web application to navigate from page to page, pass data, and interact with a database.</p><br />

									<p>Looking back at this project it is interesting to see how many things I could have done better, and how much I have learned since then. From a user experience point of view, the two main area for improvement are mobile responsiveness and dynamic display of formatted run/workout data. These are areas that I feel I have greatly improved upon with the my work at the Calgary Counselling Centre and with this personal portfolio website. If I were to do the training log project again a lot of things would be different, but overall I think it was a good learning experience.</p>
